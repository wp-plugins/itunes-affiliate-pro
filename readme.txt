Earn money effortlessly from your conent with iTunes Affiliate Pro.

== Description ==

Do you link to the iTunes store in your content? If yes, make money with your iTunes links using iTunes Affiliate Pro.

**How does it work?**

iTunes Affiliate Pro is an affiliate plugin that automatically parses your content and inserts affiliate links directly into posts without you doing any work.

Do you run a website? Are you looking for new ways to monetize your content? iTunes Affiliate Pro can start making you money immediately without making any changes to your existing website.

Simple. Before WordPress outputs a post, page, or custom post type; iTunes Affiliate Pro searches for a particular URL ('http://itunes.apple.com/us/app...') string. If a match is found iTunes Affiliate Pro rewrites the link URL and adds an iTunes affiliate URL.

**Getting Started**

Once you have configured iTunes Affiliate Pro, try adding the following HTML to a post. &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/draw-something-by-omgpop/id488627858&quot;&gt;Draw Something&lt;/a&gt;

If you have configured the plugin correctly and checked the `Activate Filter` checkbox you will see an affiliate URL in place of the iTunes URL.

**Affiliate Program Details**

The LinkShare program pays affiliates 5% of all purchases made within 3 days of clicking on one of your affiliate links. Assuming the visitor doesn't click on another affiliate link, you receive commissions on all purchases the user makes in the iTunes store. Since most new iPhone & iPad users go on a downloading frenzy after initially purchasing a new device, you can quickly make money using your WordPress site. 

Reporting takes around 3-4 days to show up in LinkShare. If you don't see any sales after that period you'll want to make sure you have setup iTunes Affiliate Pro correctly.
