Automatically adds iTunes affiliate links to content.

== Description ==

iTunes Affiliate Pro is a hands off affiliate plugin that automatically parses your content and inserts affiliate links directly into your posts without you doing any work.

Do you run a website and are you looking for new ways to monetize your content? iTunes Affiliate Pro can start making you money immediately without any added content editing.

**How does it work?**

Simple. Before WordPress outputs a post/page, iTunes Affiliate Pro searches for a particular URL ('http://itunes.apple.com/us/app...') string. If a match is found iTunes Affiliate Pro rewrites the link URL and adds an iTunes affiliate URL.

**Working Example**

== Installation ==
