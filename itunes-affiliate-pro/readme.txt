Automatically adds iTunes affiliate links to content.

== Description ==

iTunes Affiliate Pro is a hands off affiliate plugin that automatically parses your content and inserts affiliate links directly into your posts without you doing any work.

Do you run a website and are you looking for new ways to monetize your content? iTunes Affiliate Pro can start making you money immediately without any added content editing.

How does it work?

Simple. Before WordPress outputs a post/page, iTunes Affiliate Pro searches for a particular URL string. If a match is found iTunes Affiliate Pro rewrites the link and adds an iTunes affiliate anchor tag.
